Description,"These figures are the results from the 2001 Census in Scotland. They are final figures of the resident population as at Census Day, 29 April 2001, after adjusting for estimated under-enumeration in the Census. The Census results have been adjusted to take account of estimated underenumeration in the Census based on the One Number Census methodology, which used the results of the Census Coverage Survey. As a result of the adjustments for underenumeration and changes to the definition of the resident population, it is not appropriate to compare directly the results from the 2001 Census with earlier Censuses. More information on this is available on the National Records of Scotland's website . The resident population of Scotland on Census Day (29 April 2001) was 5,062,011, of which 52 per cent were female and 48 per cent were male. Children aged 15 and under accounted for 19 per cent of the population, people of working age (16-59F/64M) accounted for 62 per cent, and people of retirement age (60F/65M +) accounted for the remaining 19 per cent. More detailed Census results are now available via the SCROL website .","These figures are the results from the 2001 Census in Scotland.
